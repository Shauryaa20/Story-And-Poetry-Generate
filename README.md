VerseCraft is an AI-powered web application that enables users to generate original stories and poems based on a selected theme, optional user prompt, and word limit. Built with a clean user interface and backed by advanced **Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence)** models, this project merges creativity with cutting-edge natural language generation.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user selects between generating a **Story** or a **Poem**.
2. They choose a theme and optionally provide a text prompt and word limit.
3. This data is passed to a backend service (or processed client-side via API).
4. A **Seq2Seq model** interprets the input and generates a structured, meaningful output.
5. The output is rendered instantly in the UI.
